---------------
Kong’s routing configuration, not in your OpenAPI spec.

🔍 It tells Kong:
“Match a request like /genai/azure/gpt-4o/chat/completions and extract the provider and deployment_id parts from the URL.”

These named capture groups (?<provider> and ?<deployment_id>) allow you to:

Dynamically route requests to different upstream services or paths

Use those values in Kong plugins, like request transformation or logging
