Path Structure
The base path is /genai/{provider}/{deployment_id}/{action}, where {provider} can be:

azure for Azure OpenAI models (chat, embeddings).

bedrock for Bedrock models (with sub-providers like anthropic and cohere).

{deployment_id} represents the specific deployment or model identifier (like gpt-4o, claude-v2, command-r).

{action} refers to the type of API request, either chat/completions or embeddings.

Path Parameters

The path parameters are correctly defined for the OpenAPI spec: {provider} and {deployment_id} are extracted from the URL.

The {provider} parameter is used to distinguish between the different LLM services (Azure, Bedrock Anthropic, Bedrock Cohere).

The {deployment_id} is used to specify the specific deployment model to interact with.

Specifying Actions

The paths are clearly divided by actions: chat/completions and embeddings.

This makes it possible to separate and define unique operations for each AI provider.

Paths Overview
1. Azure OpenAI (Chat and Embeddings)
Chat Completion:

/genai/azure/{deployment_id}/chat/completions

Embedding:

/genai/azure/{deployment_id}/embeddings

2. Bedrock Anthropic (Claude) (Chat Completion)
/genai/bedrock/anthropic/{deployment_id}/chat/completions

3. Bedrock Cohere (Command R) (Chat Completion and Embedding)
Chat Completion:

/genai/bedrock/cohere/{deployment_id}/chat/completions

Embedding:

/genai/bedrock/cohere/{deployment_id}/embeddings
